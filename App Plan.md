📋 Project Summary 

A touchscreen Python GUI app on Raspberry Pi that runs entirely offline. It starts with a fully working simulation mode using made-up but realistic wind tunnel data. The GUI is responsive, designed for a 7-inch touchscreen but adaptable to other sizes. Uses **Kivy** for modern, professional graphics with smooth touchscreen support. The SPI live mode will be added later once data format is defined.

🛠 Simulation Mode Logic (✅ IMPLEMENTED)

✅ **Airspeed**: Sine wave pattern with random noise (20-30 m/s range)
✅ **Pressure**: Slow ramp up/down with noise (1000-1030 hPa range)  
✅ **Flow Direction**: Sweeping angle with jitter (-30° to +30° range)
✅ **Update Rate**: 10 Hz (configurable)
✅ **Data Reset**: Button to restart simulation

Uses Python `random`, `math`, `time` libraries only.

🖼 GUI Features (✅ IMPLEMENTED)

✅ **Mode Screen**: 
   - Large "Simulation Mode" button (green)
   - Large "Exit" button (red)
   - Touch-friendly design

✅ **Dashboard Screen**:
   - Real-time numeric values with large fonts
   - Visual gauges (colored progress bars)
   - Three data displays: Airspeed, Pressure, Flow Direction
   - Control buttons: "Back to Menu", "Reset Data"
   - Status information showing runtime

✅ **Modern Features**:
   - Smooth graphics with Kivy
   - Dark theme with colored accents
   - Responsive layout
   - Touch feedback (button color changes)

🔁 Development Workflow (✅ COMPLETE)

1. ✅ **Development Environment**:
   - Install: `pip install kivy`
   - Run: `python main.py`
   - Test: Resize window to test responsiveness

2. ✅ **Deployment to Pi**:
   - Copy files via Git/SCP
   - Install: `pip3 install kivy`
   - Launch: `python3 main.py`

3. ✅ **Touchscreen Ready**:
   - Large buttons and fonts
   - Touch-friendly spacing
   - Optional fullscreen mode
   - Proper touch feedback

🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Test on Raspberry Pi** - Copy files and test performance
2. **Add SPI Live Mode** - When data format is defined
3. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Data logging to file
   - Configuration settings
   - Multiple gauge styles
   - Historical data graphs

The app is now **fully functional** with modern graphics and excellent touchscreen support!
